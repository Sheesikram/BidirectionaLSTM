Fake News Classifier Using Bidirectional LSTM
This repository contains code for a Fake News Classifier using a Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) model. The classifier is designed to distinguish between real and fake news articles by leveraging sequential patterns within the text. This project showcases the use of deep learning with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for binary text classification.

Project Overview
With the widespread issue of misinformation, this project aims to detect fake news articles by analyzing text content. Using a Bidirectional LSTM model, the classifier processes text in both forward and backward directions, capturing richer context for improved accuracy in distinguishing fake news from real news.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, tokenization, and padding for text data.
Bi-LSTM Model Architecture: A bidirectional neural network captures sequential dependencies from both directions, providing a comprehensive context.
Evaluation Metrics: Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the framework used)
Jupyter Notebook (for running the .ipynb file)
Additional libraries for data handling and visualization, such as:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Install the required packages by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FakeNewsClassifierUsingBiLSTM.git
cd FakeNewsClassifierUsingBiLSTM
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook FakeNewsClassifierUsingBiLSTM.ipynb
Run the Notebook Cells: Execute each cell in the notebook to preprocess data, train the Bi-LSTM model, and evaluate its performance.

Model Architecture
The Bidirectional LSTM model architecture includes:

Embedding Layer: Maps each word to a dense vector representing its semantic meaning.
Bidirectional LSTM Layer: Processes text sequences in both forward and backward directions, capturing dependencies from both ends.
Fully Connected Layers: Layers that combine the learned features and output a classification score (fake or real).
Dataset
The project requires a labeled dataset of news articles (fake and real) for training the model. Some commonly used datasets for fake news classification include:

Fake and Real News Dataset (available on Kaggle)
LIAR: A Benchmark Dataset for Fake News Detection
Ensure your dataset is formatted appropriately (e.g., a CSV file with text and label columns).

Results
The notebook evaluates the model's performance on multiple metrics:

Accuracy: The overall correctness of the model’s predictions.
Precision and Recall: Measures for evaluating the model’s performance on each class.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, particularly useful for imbalanced datasets.
Example
Below is a sample usage of the trained Bi-LSTM model:

python
Copy code
# Assuming `model` is the trained Bi-LSTM model and `new_article` is a text input
prediction = model.predict(new_article)
print("Fake News" if prediction == 0 else "Real News")
Limitations
Data Dependency: The model’s accuracy is closely tied to the quality and diversity of the training data.
Computational Resources: Bi-LSTM models can be memory-intensive, especially with long sequences and large datasets.
Training Time: Training a Bi-LSTM can take longer compared to unidirectional LSTM models.
Future Improvements
Potential enhancements include:

Exploring advanced models like BERT and Transformers for better context understanding.
Experimenting with larger and more diverse datasets to improve generalization.
Incorporating attention mechanisms to help the model focus on important words or phrases.
